# vim

If you are interested in a more ergonomic and keyboard driven workflow, I highly suggest that you learn the vim keybinds. Vim is an entirely new way of editing text from which you are normally used to and amazing things can be achieved with the power modal editing that vim offers. Vim can be integrated well with vs code, so you can have all the awesome features of vs code, while still having the power of vim commands and modal editing.

Go talk to Victor HÃ¥kansson or Lajla Guelli if you are interested and they can help you setup and get started :)
